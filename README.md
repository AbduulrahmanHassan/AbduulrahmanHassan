## 🚀 About Me
I am a **Communication and Computer Engineering Graduate (2025)** and currently a **Game Development Student at the Information Technology Institute (ITI)**. 

I bridge the gap between high-level **VR/XR simulation** and low-level **Game Engine Architecture**. My focus is on building immersive safety systems using Unity, while simultaneously mastering the core mechanics of graphics rendering and memory optimization using C++ and OpenGL.
